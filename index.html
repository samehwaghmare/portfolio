              <h2>Web Coding ICA</h2>
              <p>
                For my college assignment, I developed a dynamic and engaging
                website dedicated to energy drinks. The primary focus of the
                website is to promote and provide information about various
                energy drink products in an interactive and visually appealing
                manner. To achieve this, I employed the parallax scrolling
                technique, which adds depth and dimension to the user's browsing
                experience.

              <p>
                I produced a music video for a client by utilizing a combination
                of Blender and After Effects. This multimedia project involved a
                fusion of 3D animation and post-production effects, resulting in
                a visually captivating and dynamic video that perfectly
                complemented the music's rhythm and style. Through meticulous
                attention to detail and creative design, I was able to deliver a
                music video that not only met but exceeded the client's
                expectations, underscoring the versatility and power of these
                software tools in the realm of multimedia content creation.
